The working combination for compilation:
- I installed pipenv (as admin) and created a virtual environment for my folder
- In the virtual environment, I installed scipy, numpy, matplotlib, pyqt5, and pyinstaller using:
pyenv run pip package_name
- I ran: pipenv run pyinstaller GUI.py
- This created a spec file. I modified the spec file to include verbose and to include scipy.messagebox as hiddenimport (whatever that does, it was needed)
- I ran the command (as admin) in windows powershell:
pipenv run pyinstaller --onedir --noupx --clean GUI.py
- This gave me a permission error
- I ran it again and there was no problem anymore 
- I mannually coppied the Images folder into the generated dist folder. This finally got me a working exe.
